# Thinking With Grid, a talk by Jen Simmons at Artifact Conf

**Jen Simmons** live coded a print layout she had not seen before using CSS grid at **Artifact Conf 2019** in Austin, Texas. I thought I would give something similar a try. It's not perfect, but it's been fun to play with. Responsive is still a bit weird but, we'll make it work.
